I couldn't have written this by myself. I have to thank the following people for helping me make this what it is today.

Thanks to
=========
- Aaron Schmidt
- Asi Sudai
- Caitlin Mortimer
- Chris Penny
- Emily Lampson

And last, but not least, **You**. Thank you very much for taking the time to read my ramblings on Python. If this helped you to learn Python, then because of you, I am a step closer to ~~world domination~~ spreading the knowledge of scripting to everyone working in the animation, VFX, and games industry.
